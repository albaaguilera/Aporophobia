    "The first simplified version of the model contemplates a grid where all of the agents are assigned a home. The agents can do some actions, regulated by the time of the model. The actions take them to particular locations inside the grid. They also receive an income every month, so the positions and wealth histogram distribution can be plotted using the data collection module in mesa. \n",

    "- *CityModel*: represents a city as a collection of districts. Each CItyModel object contains a 'name' attribute to identify the city and a dictionary 'districts' that maps district names to their DistrictGrid objects. The __init__ method sets the name and districts attributes. It takes a collection of DistrictGrid objects as input and converts it into a dictionary that maps each district's name to its object using a dictionary comprehension.\n",

    "- *Wealth*: Renda neta mitjana per persona dividida entre els 12 mesos de l'any i seleccionada per districtes.\n",
    "- *Age* and *Gender*: Edats i sexe assignats segons les proporcions a cada districte. (Nombre de persones amb x edat de cert sexe per districtes). L'*status* s'assigna a partir de l'edat, per sota de 16 anys l'agent serà student, entre 16 i 22 amb probabilitats extretes d'opendata, serà student, employed or unemployed, entre 22 i 67 employed or unemployed i per sobre de 67 retired. \n",
    "- *District*: Districte assignat segons la proporció de població real vivint a cada districte.\n",
