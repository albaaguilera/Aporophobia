# An Agent-Based Model for Poverty and Discrimination Policy-Making

The aim of this project is to study the effect of aporophobic and non-aporophobic regulatory policies into and agent-based model (ABM) populated by autonomous decision-making agents using real demographic data. In particular, it has been considered the case of four Barcelona districts using data from Opendata site \cite{Open_data}. This study seeks to analyze the effect of norms, labelled as aporophobic or non aporophobic by legal experts on the levels of poverty and inequality. 

The main model formulation notebook and code (including the Data, City, Agent and Model classes) can be found in the Model Formulation folder, along with the UML diagram and Needs dictionary graph script. In contrast, the trial and cluster notebooks are located in the Results folder, alongside with the submission script \textit{run\_model.py}.
