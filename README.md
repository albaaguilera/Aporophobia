# An Agent-Based Model for Poverty and Discrimination Policy-Making

The aim of this project is to study the effect of aporophobic and non-aporophobic regulatory policies using an agent-based model (ABM). This simulation is populated by autonomous decision-making agents built from real demographic data. In particular, we extract data from Opendata site, filtering for four different Barcelona districts. This study seeks to analyze the effect of norms, labelled as aporophobic or non-aporophobic by legal experts, on the levels of poverty and inequality. 

The Github repository is structured in three main folders containing: 

1. Model Formulation: 5 main code files (model, agent, city, data, model and norms. 
2. Open Data: 8 demographic datasets required to initialize the simulation.
3. Results: submission scrip to the cluster, cluster's results and analysis of them with jupyter notebooks. 

Additionally, there is a UML diagram to illustrate the dependencies between the different files.
